# Sparshless Finger Capture — Quick Start

Welcome! This simple guide shows how to install and use the `Sparshless Finger Capture` Android app for the first time. Follow each step exactly and you'll be taking good finger photos in minutes.

Before you start

- Make sure you have the APK file on your device (e.g., `Sparshless Finger Capture.apk`) or a link to download it.
- Your device should have Android 8.0 or newer and a working rear camera.

1. Install the app

- Open the file manager or `Downloads` on your phone and tap the APK file.
- If your phone says "Install blocked" or asks to allow installs from the browser or file manager, tap `Settings` and enable `Allow from this source`, then return and tap the APK again.
- Tap `Install`. When it finishes, tap `Open`.

2. Grant camera permission

- The app will ask for permission to use the camera the first time it runs. Tap `Allow` so the app can take pictures.
- If you denied by mistake, open `Settings → Apps → Sparshless Finger Capture → Permissions` and turn on `Camera`.

3. Quick walkthrough of the app

- Open `Finger-capture` from your apps list.
- Choose which hand to capture: `Left` or `Right`.
- You'll see a camera preview with a guide. Place your finger inside the guide and hold still.
- Tap the big round button to take the photo.
- The app shows the photo with two choices: `Retake` or `Confirm`.
- Tap `Retake` to try again, or `Confirm` to save and move on.

4. Taking good photos — simple tips

- Use even, soft lighting (avoid direct sunlight or backlight).
- Hold the phone steady; rest your elbows on a table if needed.
- Clean the camera lens before starting.

5. After you've captured images

- Confirmed photos are saved inside the app and kept private on your phone.

Troubleshooting — quick fixes

- The camera preview is black: ensure `Camera` permission is allowed and restart the app.
- The capture button doesn't respond: force-close the app and reopen it.
- Photos are blurry: improve lighting and keep the phone steady.
- App crashes: reinstall the APK. If the problem continues, contact the person who gave you the APK and tell them your phone model and Android version.

Uninstalling

- To remove the app, long-press the app icon and choose `Uninstall`, or go to `Settings → Apps → Sparshless Finger Capture → Uninstall`.

Privacy note

- Photos are stored locally by default. If the app uploads photos, it will ask for your confirmation.
